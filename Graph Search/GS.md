# Graph search

Algorithms for traversing/searching a graph data structure.

## Breadth-First Search

It starts at some arbitrary node of the graph and explores all the neighbour nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth i.e. it's neighbours.

## Depth-First Search

Starts at some arbitrary node  and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
