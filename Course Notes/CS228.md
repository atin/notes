**Important Note**: This post does not contain explanations, proofs etc, it only contains definitions and theorems etc i.e. it's more like a cheat sheet rather than notes.

## Definitions and theorems

### Lecture 1 & 2

- A is countable if $$|A| \leq |\mathbb{N}|$$
- Cantor's Theorem - $$|A| \leq |\mathcal{P}(A)|$$
- A *parse tree* of a formula $$F \in P$$ is a tree s.t.
  - $$F$$ is the root
  - leaves are atomic formulas(T, $$\perp$$, $$p \in Vars$$)
  - Each internal node is formed by applying some formation rule on its children
- $$F \in P \iff$$ there is a parse tree of $$F$$
- Each $$F \in P$$ has a unique parsing tree
- A formula G is a subformula of F if G occurs within F. G is proper subformula if G $$\neq$$ F. The nodes of parse tree of F forms set of subformulas of F denoted by *sub(F)*
- Precedence order
  1.  $$\neg$$, then
  2. $$\vee, \wedge, \oplus$$ and in the end
  3. $$\implies, \iff$$

### Lecture 3

- A model is an element of $$Vars \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$$, here $$\mathcal{B} = \{0,1\}$$
- The satisfaction relation $$\models$$ between models and formulas is the smallest relation that satisfies [these conditions](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~akg/courses/2021-logic/lec-03-truth-table.pdf) (check page 5)
- m satisfies F if m $$\models$$ F
- F is **satisfiable** if there is a model m s.t. m $$\models$$ F
- F is **valid** (written $$\models$$ F) if for each model m, m $$\models$$ F
- F is **unsatisfiable** (written $$\not\models$$ F) if there is no model m s.t. m $$\models$$ F
- A valid formula is also called a **tautology**

- F $$\equiv$$ G if for each model m, m $$\models$$ F $$\iff$$ m $$\models$$ G
- Formulas F and G are **equisatisfiable** if F is sat $$\iff$$ G is sat
- F and G are **equivalid** if $$\models$$ F $$\iff$$ $$\models$$ G



- M(set of models) $$\models$$ F if for each m $$\in$$ M, m $$\models$$ F

Let $$\small\sum$$ be a set of formulas.

- $$\small\sum\models$$ F if for each model m that satisfies each formula in $$\small\sum$$, m $$\models$$ F

- $$\small\sum\models$$ F is read $$\small\sum$$ implies F
