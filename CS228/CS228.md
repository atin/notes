## Definitions and theorems

### Lecture 1 & 2

- A is countable if $$|A| \leq |\mathbb{N}|$$
- Cantor's Theorem - $$|A| \leq |\mathcal{P}(A)|$$
- A _parse tree_ of a formula $$F \in P$$ is a tree s.t.
  - $$F$$ is the root
  - leaves are atomic formulas(T, $$\perp$$, $$p \in Vars$$)
  - Each internal node is formed by applying some formation rule on its children
- $$F \in P \iff$$ there is a parse tree of $$F$$
- Each $$F \in P$$ has a unique parsing tree
- A formula G is a subformula of F if G occurs within F. G is proper subformula if G $$\neq$$ F. The nodes of parse tree of F forms set of subformulas of F denoted by _sub(F)_
- Precedence order
  1.  $$\neg$$, then
  2.  $$\vee, \wedge, \oplus$$ and in the end
  3.  $$\implies, \iff$$

### Lecture 3

- A model is an element of $$Vars \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$$, here $$\mathcal{B} = \{0,1\}$$
- The satisfaction relation $$\models$$ between models and formulas is the smallest relation that satisfies [these conditions](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~akg/courses/2021-logic/lec-03-truth-table.pdf) (check page 5)
- m satisfies F if m $$\models$$ F
- F is **satisfiable** if there is a model m s.t. m $$\models$$ F
- F is **valid** (written $$\models$$ F) if for each model m, m $$\models$$ F
- F is **unsatisfiable** (written $$\not\models$$ F) if there is no model m s.t. m $$\models$$ F
- A valid formula is also called a **tautology**

- F $$\equiv$$ G if for each model m, m $$\models$$ F $$\iff$$ m $$\models$$ G
- Formulas F and G are **equisatisfiable** if F is sat $$\iff$$ G is sat
- F and G are **equivalid** if $$\models$$ F $$\iff$$ $$\models$$ G

- M(set of models) $$\models$$ F if for each m $$\in$$ M, m $$\models$$ F

Let $$\small\sum$$ be a set of formulas.

- $$\small\sum\models$$ F if for each model m that satisfies each formula in $$\small\sum$$, m $$\models$$ F

- $$\small\sum\models$$ F is read $$\small\sum$$ implies F

#### Decidability of SAT

A problem is decidable if there is an algorithm to solve the problem.

The following problem is called the satisfiability problem: For a given F $$\in$$ P, is F satisfiable?

- The propositional satisfiability problem is decidable

A model m is in $$Vars \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$$. We can extend m to P $$\rightarrow \mathcal{B}$$ in the following way.

$$
m(F)=
\begin{cases}
1 & m \models F\\
0 & \text{Otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

The extended m is called **truth function**.

- For each finite boolean function f, there is a formula F that represents f.
